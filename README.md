#### UX

The quiz will be focusing only on the lore of dead by daylight, with many contraversial change in the gameplay mechanic, it is amusing to just diving into the lore and the fact instead of gameplay.

The font I use for the logo is Lato, whihc is similar to the original logo as can be seen below:

For the text in the quiz, I use Roboto for easy read and the simply look it has.
